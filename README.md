# IMSC 2024 Short Course: Computational and Statistical Proteomic Analysis

The growth of biological MS deepens the need to understand computation and statistics; these skills are essential for the interpretation of proteomic studies. Designed for mass spectrometrists at an intermediate level, this course incorporates real-world use cases for the computational tools used to identify and quantify proteins/peptides. This tutorial will emphasize the design of well-powered studies, the conceptional frameworks associated with the identification of peptides and PTMs, and the detection and quantitation of biological differences. Participants will be introduced to methods for visualising and interpreting datasets, including statistical techniques using common bioinformatics tools such as the R statistical environment. At the conclusion of this course participants should have a working understanding of the key considerations associated with computational analysis of proteomic datasets.
